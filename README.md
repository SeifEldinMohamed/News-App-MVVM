# Description
NewsApp is a tiny little app which brings the latest news from newsApi.org . Internally app uses News API to fetch the details.
This app is built using Clean + MVVM architecture, uses Retrofit2 for making API calls and uses Room database to cache the data.
We can save our favourite articles so you can see them more than one time (you can delete it after that). 
Also uses pagination to prevent loading the hole data at one time.
